## About the Video Course
This video course will introduce you to the concept of mobile hybrid applications and how PhoneGap can help you create applications that can function on different platforms without having to rewrite the code. This course will focus on iOS and Android apps. You will be led through setting up a PhoneGap development environment, and then will be guided through creating a simple application that uses some of the core features of PhoneGap
There on we will move on to some complex topics in the PhoneGap world. In the first volume, we’ll cover how to effectively debug hybrid applications using both Chrome and Safari remote debugging. We’ll see the ways in which you can make the app work for a wide user base, including internationalization and globalization and accessibility.
More advanced topics will be covered in the last volume. This would involve complex uses of PhoneGap, interacting with external servers, dealing with security, and testing and automation.
